Liberty Tools for IntelliJ IDEA is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin for developing cloud-native Java applications with [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/) and [WebSphere Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-liberty). Iterate fast with Liberty dev mode, code with assistance for MicroProfile and Jakarta EE APIs, and easily edit Liberty configuration files.

Liberty Tools for IntelliJ includes [LSP4IJ](https://github.com/redhat-developer/lsp4ij), an external plugin dependency that is automatically installed with Liberty Tools. LSP4IJ is a free and open-source Language Server Protocol (LSP) client developed by Red Hat, enabling seamless language server integration.

If you wish to change the version of LSP4IJ installed along with Liberty Tools, you can refer to the documentation [here](docs/user-guide.md#manually-install-specific-release-of-the-lsp4ij-plugin-from-the-marketplace).

Use Liberty Tools to run your Liberty Maven or Liberty Gradle projects through the Liberty tool window or the IntelliJ "Search Everywhere" window. You can start, stop, or interact with [Liberty dev mode](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html) on all configured [Liberty Maven](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/master/docs/dev.md#dev) and [Liberty Gradle](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/master/docs/libertyDev.md) projects in your workspace. Liberty Tools also helps you quickly and easily edit your application and configuration files by providing language support features for MicroProfile, Jakarta EE, and Liberty configuration and Java files.

For minimum requirements information and detailed instructions on how to use Liberty Tools, check out the [Liberty Tools for IntelliJ IDEA user guide](docs/user-guide.md) page.

## Features
- View Liberty projects in the Liberty tool window.
- Start/Stop dev mode.
- Start dev mode with custom parameters.
- Start dev mode in a container.
- Start dev mode with the debugger attached.
- Run tests.
- View test reports.
- Code with language assistance in the following configuration and application files:
    - `server.xml`, `server.env`, `bootstrap.properties` Liberty configuration files

Editing assistance for configuration and application files is provided through the following language server projects, which this project consumes. For more information, see the documentation for these projects.

- Liberty configuration files: [Liberty Config Language Server](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-language-server#liberty-config-language-server)
- Jakarta EE APIs in Java files:  [Eclipse LSP4Jakarta](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4jakarta#eclipse-lsp4jakarta), the Language Server for Jakarta EE.
- MicroProfile APIs in `microprofile-config.properties` and Java files: [Eclipse LSP4MP](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4mp#eclipse-lsp4mp---language-server-for-microprofile), the Language Server for MicroProfile.

## Quick start

- Install [_Liberty Tools_ from the JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14856-liberty-tools).
- Select a project in the Liberty tool window to view the available commands.

Projects with the Liberty Maven Plugin or Liberty Gradle Plugin configured will appear in the Liberty tool window on the sidebar. If the tool window is not enabled by default, you can view it by selecting **View > Tool Windows > Liberty**.

> Note: Make sure the **JAVA_HOME** system environment variable is set to define the JDK for running Liberty dev mode.

## Technical support
If you experience a problem with this plugin you might be asked to collect language server messages to assist in problem determination. Follow these steps:
1. Click the **Language Servers** tool window in the IntelliJ IDE to show the **LSP Consoles**.
2. Select the language server you need to monitor and then select **Trace:** **verbose**.
3. Save the configuration.
4. Perform the actions that demonstrate the issue and messages will appear in the console. Click a message and select all the text in the console, for example, Ctrl-A on Windows or Cmd-A on MacOS. Copy the text and paste it into a message to send to the developer who is assisting you with the issue.
