## Before you begin
### Software requirements
<!-- Make sure to also update the main README.md note at its top, and its #Requirements section -->
- **IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1** or later. Liberty Tools for IntelliJ IDEA is compatible with the Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA.
- **Java 17** or later. If you change the IntelliJ IDEA Boot Java Runtime through the **Change Boot Java Runtime for the IDE** preference, ensure that you are using Java 17 or later.
- [Liberty Tools for IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14856-liberty-tools/)

### Application requirements
- Define a Liberty `server.xml` configuration file in the `src/main/liberty/config` location.
- [Configure the Liberty Maven Plugin](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven#configuration) or [configure the Liberty Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle#adding-the-plugin-to-the-build-script). We recommend using the most recent versions of the plugins as they include several important bug fixes.

    - [Liberty Maven Plugin latest release](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/releases/latest)

    - [Liberty Gradle Plugin latest release](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/releases/latest)

### Settings
Liberty Tools for IntelliJ IDEA honors the following settings:

#### IntelliJ settings:
- The Maven home path that is set in the **Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven** window when you run Liberty dev mode on Maven projects.
- The Gradle Distribution that is set in the **Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle** window when you run Liberty dev mode on Gradle projects.

#### Environment Variables:
- The **JAVA_HOME** system environment variable in the current terminal is used when you run Liberty dev mode in any project.

## Open the Liberty tool window
Select **View > Tool Windows > Liberty**.

Projects that are already properly configured to run on Liberty and use Liberty dev mode are automatically added to the Liberty tool window when it opens. If your Liberty project does not show up in the Liberty tool window automatically and you have the Liberty Maven or Liberty Gradle plugin configured, check out [how to manually add your project to the Liberty tool window](#manually-add-your-liberty-project-to-the-tool-window).

If you add new projects or make changes, use the refresh icon in the Liberty tool window toolbar to refresh the tool window.

## Run your application on Liberty using dev mode

Three menu actions are available to start your Liberty application in dev mode through the Liberty tool window view or the "Search Everywhere" IntelliJ IDEA window: [Start](#start), [Start...](#start-with-configuration), or [Start in container](#start-in-container).

### Use the Liberty tool window

The Liberty tool window provides a context menu for Liberty projects. You can choose different actions from the menu to speed up application development.

![Liberty tool window](images/liberty-tool-window-view.png)

### Use the Search Everywhere IntelliJ IDEA window

The Liberty Tools plugin provides a set of actions for the **Search Everywhere** IntelliJ IDEA window. You can access the **Search Everywhere** window either by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> twice, then selecting the **Actions** tab, or  by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>. All Liberty Tools actions that are described in the following sections are also available from the **Search Everywhere** window.

### Start your application in dev mode with configuration

To start your application in dev mode with custom configuration, select the **Start...** action for your application in the Liberty tool window. The action opens a Liberty Edit Configuration dialog. You can specify parameters for the [Liberty Maven dev goal](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/dev.md#additional-parameters) or [Liberty Gradle dev task](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/main/docs/libertyDev.md#command-line-parameters).

![Liberty Start... action](images/liberty-start-with-config.png)

When you finish customizing the configuration, click **Run**.

A new terminal tab opens to run the application in dev mode.

![Liberty Start... action running in terminal](images/liberty-start-with-config-terminal.png)

The configuration that is shown in the **Edit Configuration** dialog is created and displayed automatically if a Run/Debug configuration is not already associated with the project. If a single configuration is already associated with the project, that configuration is displayed. If multiple configurations are already associated with the project, the highlighted/last run configuration is displayed.

### Start your application in dev mode in a container

To use dev mode for containers, select the **Start in container** action for your application in the Liberty tool window.

![Liberty Start in container action](images/liberty-start-in-container.png)

For more information on dev mode for containers, check out the [Liberty Maven devc goal](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/dev.md#devc-container-mode) or the [Liberty Gradle libertyDevc task](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/main/docs/libertyDev.md#libertydevc-task-container-mode).

## Run your application tests

After your application is running on Liberty using dev mode, you can easily run the tests provided by your application.

To run tests, select the **Run tests** action for your application in the Liberty tool window.

The tests are run in the corresponding terminal.

## View your application test reports

After you finish running your application tests, you can access the produced test reports. Test reports open in your external default browser.

### Maven-built applications

To view the integration test report for Maven-built applications, select the **View integration test report** action for your application in the Liberty tool window.

This action looks for the integration test report at the `/target/site/failsafe-report.html` default location.

To view the unit test report for Maven-built applications, select the **View unit test report** action for your application in the Liberty tool window.

This action looks for the unit test report at the `/target/site/surefire-report.html` default location.

### Gradle-built applications

To view the test report for Gradle-built applications, select the **View test report** action for your application in the Liberty tool window.

This action looks for the unit test report at the `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` default location.

## Stop your application

To stop your application, select the **Stop** action for your application in the Liberty tool window.
